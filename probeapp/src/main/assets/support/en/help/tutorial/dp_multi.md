# DP level multi-point calibration

Use this when both transmitters are installed identically and the error is approximately linear (zero shift + span error).

Record multiple stable points:

- Reference level %% (e.g., A)
- B current differential pressure (ΔPnow)
- B current LRV/URV

Then open **DP Level → Range Recalc → Multi-point** and calculate the new LRV/URV.
